# Quick'n'dirty assignment of talks to slots


This project is a rudimentary and short exploration of how a set of talks could
be assigned to a given set of slots given participant's priorities. It uses the
DEAP library for optimization.


As of now, the number of talks/participants/priorities/slots are fixed in the
code; changing them is straightforward, however.
